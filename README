This is a fork of OpenBSD's excellent cwm[0] to Linux and other Unixes.

This port requires pkg-config, Xft, and Xrandr.

Current features which differ from cwm are:

	* RandR is used for monitor detection, not Xinerama;
	* group0 is no longer special, it's just another group;
		- Toggling all groups is available as a command.
	* Groups are per RandR output, and are separate for each output;
	* Status output sent to named FIFOs for each monitor detected:
		- Can be parsed and used with dzen2, for instance, check the
		  read_status.pl file for an example of this.
